# NCD Demo Project Plan

The project stores the login information on the blockchain and gives it to the user. 

I will create a class with user id and string value in it. Then I will create a storage containing this information. I will create a change method to get this information and transfer it to the storage. Then I will create a view method that will pull this information.
